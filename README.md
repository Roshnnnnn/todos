Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

## Project Overview

I have developed a task management application, which currently functions as an individual app. The app allows users to save their tasks for future reference. My goal is to enhance this application further by incorporating several features. For instance, users will receive email reminders 15 minutes before a task's scheduled completion time. Additionally, I plan to introduce the capability to save images and videos alongside text. Furthermore, I have implemented a custom hook to facilitate smoother functionality within the application.
